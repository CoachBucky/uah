# AI Acceptable Use Policy for High School Students

## A Student's Guide to Ethical AI Use

As a student, you are on the front lines of AI in education. Here's how you can use these powerful tools responsibly and ethically to enhance your learning.

| üéØ **Understand AI's Purpose** | üí¨ **Be Transparent** | ü§î **Critically Evaluate Everything** |
|---|---|---|
| Use AI as a tool to brainstorm, get feedback, and learn more efficiently‚Äînot to do your thinking for you. The goal is to enhance your skills, not replace them. | Honesty builds trust. Always tell your teacher when and how you used AI in your work, following the specific citation rules for your class. | Don't blindly trust AI. It can be wrong or biased. Always fact-check its outputs, question its reasoning, and compare it with other reliable sources. |

| üôà **Don't Overshare Personal Data** | üìù **Don't Ignore the Rules** | ‚úÖ **Know Your Rights & Rules** |
|---|---|---|
| Be very careful about what personal information (name, grades, location) you give to AI tools. Use a burner email when possible to protect your privacy. | Understand your school's specific policies on AI use. Misrepresenting AI work as your own has serious consequences for academic integrity. | Familiarize yourself with your school's academic integrity policy regarding AI. Knowing the rules helps you avoid accidental missteps and ensures fairness. |
